# Automatic-Dataset-Cleaner
A prototype for a python program with a ui that would automate dataset cleaning. Made for my final year project.

This project centers around reducing the time it takes to clean data. Usually it can take 10 minutes to an hour to clean data, however, this prototype can reduce the time to one minute.
